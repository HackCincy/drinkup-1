# I can Drinkup and so can you

Back in March of 2012, [Chris Ridenour][cridenour] and I had a quick [Twitter exchange][tweet] 
about bringing the local Python, Ruby and JavaScript user groups together. We're all fans of
tech and keeping it in a few small silos felt strange. I'm interested in what the Python group
is up to, too. We didn't want the formal user group structure, so we decided to start the 
Cincinnati Web/Tech Drinkup. Turns out, people liked the idea. Just over a year later there 
are 630+ members and more than 100 attendees each month.

My intent is to document the process, what we learned and to give you a way to start something
in your own city.

## Getting Started

#### Keys

In my experience, there are a couple factors that will help significantly:

* Be consistent on both time and location. Our event is the first Thursday at 5pm at [Japps].
* Be active in the groups of which you're already a part.
* Get friends from other groups involved.

#### Leadership

Leadership is important. If there's one thing I've taken away from this experience, it's that
putting someone in charge is not a bad thing. Delegation is important too, but having a small
number of people at the helm keeps things moving. When Chris and I decided to change the venue,
it was just an email between the two of us. We could have taken a vote or sent out surveys, but
we just decided that we had outgrown our space and we found a better location.

We'll never make everyone happy, but people enjoying the events and making meaningful connections
are more important to me. Just listen and respond.

## Venue

Convince the venue that you intend for this to be a long term relationship. Both of our venues
had very little traffic on our chosen night prior to our arrival. You'll be growing the group
which means better revenue for them as well as new faces who might not have been there before.

You'll need open space, attentive servers and, ideally, control over the audio. Our first venue
worked okay, but the music was too loud and the space too small. We outgrew it pretty quickly.

Try to get a private room, too. Keep your group together.

Also, get a single point of contact at your venue so you can communicate via email about events.
We set a maximum budget, including gratuity, and you'll want to be on the same page when it's
time to close out. As in all things, communication is key.

## Sponsors

We wanted to buy the first drink for our group. It's simple and fairly inexpensive, but it's a
great way to introduce a sponsor, make new guests feel welcome and get a chance to talk as they
walk in, too.

We split the sponsorship levels with absolutely no difference between them. They were just 
different dollar amounts. The reason was simply that we wanted to give companies of all sizes a
chance to participate. Larger, more established companies as well as local startups. There's
nothing to distinguish between the two as far as benefits.

Currently, we have two levels: First Drink ($500) and Venue ($300). As of now, we're in a space
that has a projector. We put the sponsor logos and a short (140 character) message up on a 
tweet wall. We also show hashtagged tweets from the event.

## Monthly Schedule

Here's where the work part happens, unfortunately. About a month before, you'll want your
sponsors lined up. I send an invoice using Harvest to pre-pay for the upcoming month which is 
due five days prior to the event. It's linked up with Stripe, so online payment is a piece
of cake.

I have a business account where the funds are deposited. I open the large tab and pay at the 
end of the budget. I'm in communication regularly with the bar about the tab, so I know when to
stop handing out tickets.
